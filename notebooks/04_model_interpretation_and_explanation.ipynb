    "# 04 Model Interpretation & Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook in Week 4 focuses on interpreting the results of our anomaly detection pipeline using Isolation Forest and HDBSCAN clustering. Building on the outputs of Notebooks 01-03, we draw behavioural insights and visual inferences from the models, without introducing new code logic. The focus here lies in understanding what the models reveal about the signal: its structure, its irregularities, and its interpretive value for real-world applications."

This method identified 374 anomalous points, out of a total of 7501 observations; approximately 5%, consistent with the model’s contamination parameter. These points typically reflect abrupt deviations from regular amplitude oscillations."

    "### **Step 5 - CCommentary on Cross-Validation in Unsupervised Pipelines**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, cross-validation typically relies on labelled data to assess model performance. However, in unsupervised anomaly detection, where labels are unavailable, such validation becomes more interpretive than definitive. In this step, we focus instead on the **robustness**, **overlap**, and **divergence** of outputs generated by different models in the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exemplar makes use of two complementary unsupervised methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Isolation Forest (IF)** identifies anomalies by recursively partitioning the data and isolating points that require fewer splits.\n",
    "* **HDBSCAN** labels points as noise or assigns them to clusters based on local density and hierarchical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than treating either model as authoritative, we encourage learners to reflect on their interaction and internal consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Suggested Exploratory Checks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Overlap**: Compare the points flagged as anomalies by Isolation Forest with those labelled as noise by HDBSCAN. High overlap may suggest shared detection of structural irregularity.\n",
    "* **Divergence**: Examine whether any Isolation Forest outliers are embedded within HDBSCAN clusters. These may reflect globally anomalous but locally typical behaviour, which is especially relevant in behavioural or transport modelling.\n",
    "* **Stability**: Run the pipeline on multiple random subsets of the data. Assess the consistency of model outputs using:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Internal validation metrics such as the **Silhouette Score** or **Davies–Bouldin Index**.\n",
    "  * Set-based measures such as **Jaccard Similarity** to quantify overlap in anomaly labels across subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps help learners form a critical view of unsupervised outputs without relying on ground truth, promoting deeper reasoning about the model’s behaviour and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Optional Extension:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Learners may explore a basic form of pseudo cross-validation by applying the full pipeline to repeated subsamples. Anomaly scores, cluster assignments, and overlap metrics may be tracked across runs to assess the reliability of results. This remains an optional activity and is intended to build confidence rather than serve as formal validation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Interpreting the structure and meaning of anomalies\n",
    "\n",
    "After detecting anomalies and clusters, it is essential to examine their **visual context** and **practical significance**. Anomalies should not be treated as definitive errors or artefacts. Rather, they require interpretation within the structure of the time series or the reduced latent space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, learners are encouraged to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Plot the original signal** with detected anomaly points overlaid. Reflect on their position. Do they appear at signal boundaries, isolated peaks, or periods of sudden fluctuation?\n",
    "* **Review dimensionality-reduced embeddings**, such as UMAP or PCA projections, with cluster labels and anomalies highlighted. Consider whether anomalies fall outside dense regions, or whether they cluster in unexpected areas.\n",
    "* **Annotate the behavioural or operational context**, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * “Anomalies are concentrated at signal troughs. This may indicate sensor dropout.”\n",
    "  * “Outliers emerge during transitions between regimes. These may represent decision delays or hesitation.”\n",
    "  * “High anomaly scores occur near maximum amplitude. This is often characteristic of sensor saturation.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective here is to encourage a form of **practical reasoning** about model outputs. Not all anomalies are mistakes. Some may represent rare but valid occurrences, while others may arise from known artefacts such as sensor noise, boundary distortion, or missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This interpretive practice supports learners in moving from algorithmic output to meaningful, defensible insights.\n",
