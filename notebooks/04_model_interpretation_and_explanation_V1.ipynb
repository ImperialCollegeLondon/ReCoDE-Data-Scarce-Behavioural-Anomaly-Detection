        "The exemplar pipeline consists of:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Data Preparation:** The InternalBleeding14 univariate time series was loaded and basic validation was performed (missing values, descriptive statistics).\n",
        "- **Preprocessing:** Values were scaled using MinMaxScaler to standardise the signal between 0 and 1.\n",
        "- **Isolation Forest:** An unsupervised anomaly detection model applied directly to the scaled values, identifying roughly 5% of data as anomalous.\n",
        "- **PCA Transformation:** Dimensionality reduction applied to the scaled signal for simplified cluster structure representation.\n",
        "- **HDBSCAN Clustering:** Density-based clustering used on the PCA-reduced data to discover naturally occurring behavioural groups and detect noise points.\n",
        "- **Visualisation:** Multiple plots generated to visualise original signal, Isolation Forest anomalies, PCA clusters, and combined overlays.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Model Assumptions\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "- The dataset contains a stable periodic structure with possible local anomalies.\n",
        "- Anomalies are rare and sparse (hence contamination ~5% in Isolation Forest).\n",
        "- PCA reduces complexity while retaining essential data variance.\n",
        "- HDBSCAN allows flexible, density-based cluster formation without requiring pre-defined cluster counts.\n",
        "- Noise points (`cluster = -1`) in HDBSCAN may reflect either true anomalies or weakly-structured behaviour.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Interpretation of Results\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Isolation Forest:** Detected ~374 anomalies based on deviation from normal patterns.\n",
        "- **HDBSCAN:** Identified two dominant behavioural clusters, along with ~229 noise points.\n",
        "- **Cross-validation:** Both methods broadly agree on regions of irregularity.\n",
        "- **Visual patterns:** Most anomalies occur near signal peaks, confirming sensitivity to high-amplitude deviations.\n",

        "### Educational Note\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "This exemplar demonstrates how multiple unsupervised methods can be combined to detect structural anomalies in unlabelled time series data, even under data-scarce conditions. The pipeline can generalise to real-world transport, healthcare, or engineering monitoring applications.\n",
